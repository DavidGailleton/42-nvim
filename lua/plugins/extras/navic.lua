-- Navic was... an interesting little fella i found while messing with Lualine and window-picker.
-- It attaches to nvim's winbar and shows your current code context (where you are) in an LSP-enabled file.
--
-- WARN: Navic needs to mess with the LSP to work!
-- Enabling it requires a tidbit in config/builtin/_lsp.lua which does currently exist.
-- I may remove that tidbit in the future! Enable at your own risk!
-- It also has had zero theming/configuration done whatsoever. You will need to add that in config/custom.
